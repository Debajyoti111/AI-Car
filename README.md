# AI-Car
A car simulation project where the car learns to drive by itself.

# How It Works
Neat-python is used to develop the evolving arbitrary neural networks and Pygame is used to create the GUI of the simulation. <br>
In each frame we are checking if the car is still alive, if yes then we increase fitness else we don't give reward.

# How To Run
<ul>
  <li> Clone the repository </li>
  <li> Run the newcar.py file using python compiler </li>
